## Support

Support is handled in the [WordPress forums](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/radio-button-for-taxonomies). Please note that support is limited and does not cover any custom implementation of the plugin. Before posting a question, read the [FAQ](http://wordpress.org/plugins/nav-menu-roles/faq/) and confirm that the problem still exists with a default theme and with all other plugins disabled.
