2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Find Access Manager under AWM Group Menu

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is "Initiate URL" button, under "Metaboxes & Widgets" Tab? =

Sometimes list of additional metaboxes is conditional on edit post page. Like e.g.
display custom metabox "Photos" only if Post Status is Published. Access Manager
initiates the list of metaboxes for each post in default status ("auto-draft").
That is why you have to manually initialize the URL to the edit post page where
the list of additional metaboxes can be picked by AAM.
